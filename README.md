#Git References: branches using Git Commands

#Switch to a different branch

As a shortcut, instead of creating a branch using git branch and then making it active using git checkout, you can use the git checkout command followed by the -b option, that creates the branch and makes it active in one step:

git checkout -b my1stbranch


A shortcut to adding all modifications and additions is to use the following git add command with an asterisk * .

git add *
